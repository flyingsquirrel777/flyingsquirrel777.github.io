      <br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User control and freedom</strong>: If the user accidentally add the wrong item into the shopping cart, they can remove the item from where they just clicked on or from the shopping cart. They can easily increase or decrease the amount of items they would like to buy as well.</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency and standards</strong>: This shopping website's layout and functions is similar to many other shopping websites.</li>
        <li><strong>Visibility of system status</strong>: Once you have clicked on the "add to cart" button, the "-" or the "+" button, you can see the amount of the item in the shopping cart.</li>
        <li><strong>Aesthetic and minimalist design</strong>: Simple layout. User can identify the side bar, items and the shopping cart very easily.</li>
      </ul>
