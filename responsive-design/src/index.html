		<h1 class = "text-center">Project Overview</h1>
		<p>In this project, I redesigned poorly designed website. I picked the Brown CS research website, analyzd and identified its exisiting usability problems.</p> 
		<p>Then I created low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for three screen sizes and built a responsive website based on the prototypes in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Project Goal</strong>: Practice the workflow of redesigning a simple website.</li>
			<li><strong>Tech Stack</strong>: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap</li>
			<li><strong>Redesigned website</strong>: <a href="https://flyingmonkey777.github.io/" target="_blank">Website Link</a></li>

		</ul>

			<h3>Brown CS Department Research Page</h3>
			<a class = "text-center" href="https://cs.brown.edu/research/">Link to this website.</a>
			<img src="images/brownpage.png" title="brownpage">
			<br>
			<h3>Problems</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Visibility of system status:</b> the font color of the current internal path is vague.</li>
				<li><b>User control and freedom:</b> clicking a link to any research lab will redirect to its home page, but not open in a new tab, makes it hard to go back to the last page, lead to user anxiety due to the lack of control.</li>
				<li><b>Recognition rather than recall:</b> If you click the link of Undergraduate Research, you will get to a page located at "Home » Degrees » Undergrad » Research", which can be very confusing because it has a different path from "Home » Research".</li>
				<li><b>Help and documentation:</b> The relationship of the two parallel banners of menus is confusing. The relationship of the banners and body content is also unclear. </li>
				<li><b>Visibility of system status:</b> The font color of the current internal path is vague.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Accessibility</h3>
			<p>There are 1 errors detected: 1 missing form lable. There are 15 contrast errors: all have very low contrast. There are 13 alerts: 7 of them are redundant links, and 4 of them are redundant title text.</p>

			<p>Now the website is responsive in three modes, and the navgiation bar makes more sense.</p>
