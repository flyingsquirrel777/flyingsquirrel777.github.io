      <p>Through social media, I learned about Techtogether in Boston on Oct 29th. I decided to force myself out of my comfort zone and participate. 
        It turned out to be the best decision I have ever made these three months. All the staff and volunteers were so friendly and supportive, and the workshops were very educative and exciting. 
        I formed a group with MJ and Ariana. We all had zero experience in front-end, but we managed to build a web game within 6 hours. 
        It made me realize how much I missed making something and how much I missed working in a team. 
        Challenging and intimidating as it first seemed, the hackathon gave us an opportunity to apply what we have learned to practice, to learn new knowledge with an exact purpose, 
        and to grow rapidly. Also, during the hackathon, my teammates and I  would help each other whenever we were stuck and give each other advice, 
        which allowed us to finish the challenge efficiently and with excellent quality.</p>
